#==Welcome to project miner
Sometime I need tools to assist project building process, but I can't find a suitable one.
Thanks to rails power, I easily make some for myself. Let's cultivate it gradually together...

Some functions as follows:
* make a project
* Use case list for a project


Some notes:
* maybe complement with Redmine prject
* borrow some thoughts from UML design and Axure(requirement prototype tool)
